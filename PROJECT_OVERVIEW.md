# Brewsty - Project Overview

## ✅ What's Been Created

A complete Rust-based GUI application for managing Homebrew packages on macOS with clean architecture and SOLID principles.

### Architecture Layers

1. **Domain Layer** (`src/domain/`)
   - `entities/`: Core business models (Package, PackageType, CacheInfo)
   - `repositories/`: Repository trait defining package operations interface
   - `services/`: Domain services for validation

2. **Infrastructure Layer** (`src/infrastructure/`)
   - `brew/command.rs`: Low-level Homebrew CLI commands wrapper
   - `brew/repository.rs`: Implementation of PackageRepository using Homebrew

3. **Application Layer** (`src/application/`)
   - `use_cases/`: All business logic operations (Install, Uninstall, Update, Search, Clean, etc.)
   - `dto/`: Data transfer objects

4. **Presentation Layer** (`src/presentation/`)
   - `ui/app.rs`: Main application with egui GUI
   - `components/package_list.rs`: Reusable package list component

### Key Features Implemented

✅ View installed formulae and casks
✅ Check for outdated packages  
✅ Install/uninstall packages
✅ Update individual packages or all at once
✅ Search for packages
✅ Clean cache
✅ Remove old versions
✅ Modern tabbed GUI interface with egui
✅ Async operations with Tokio
✅ Dependency injection pattern
✅ Repository pattern for testability
✅ Use case pattern for business logic

### SOLID Principles Applied

- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one clear purpose
- **Open/Closed**: Repository interface allows extending without modifying
- **Liskov Substitution**: PackageRepository can be swapped with different implementations
- **Interface Segregation**: Clean, focused trait definitions
- **Dependency Inversion**: Use cases depend on repository abstraction, not concrete implementation

## 🔧 Build Issue

The project structure is complete but build failed due to macOS system linker issues. This is NOT a code problem - it's a system configuration issue.

### To Fix:

```bash
# Install/reinstall Xcode Command Line Tools
xcode-select --install

# If that doesn't work, try:
sudo rm -rf /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools
xcode-select --install

# Then rebuild:
cargo build --release
```

## 🚀 Running the Application

Once the build issue is resolved:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

The GUI will launch with tabs for:
- **Installed**: View all installed formulae/casks
- **Outdated**: See packages that need updates
- **Search**: Find new packages to install
- **Maintenance**: Clean cache and old versions

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Fix the macOS linker issue (see above)
2. Build and run the application
3. Optional enhancements:
   - Add progress bars for long operations
   - Implement background refresh
   - Add package details view
   - Export package lists
   - Add filtering/sorting options
   - Persist user preferences
